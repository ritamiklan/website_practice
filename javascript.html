        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p class="quote">
          q. How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? <br>
          a. You console it.

        <h2>The language that powers the internet</h2>
        <p>
           JavaScript is a coding language that gives function to websites. JavaScript enables to add interactivity to sites, and allow them
            to be more, than just static representation of content. JavaScript is an interpreted language, and used mostly for front end purposes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gridthree">
        <h3>Data types</h3>
        <p>In Javascript we distinguish between three primitive datatypes: strings, numbers, and boolean.
          Data types are important for the computer to execute functions without errors.  </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gridfour">
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>A variable is a storage that stores data. The data can be initiated inside a function, 
          so its scope is only for the function, or it can be global. The data stored inside the variable 
          can change depending on conditions of the code.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gridtfive"> 
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>A function is a set of statements that either performs a specific task or calculation.
          Functions can also take parameters, so they can be applied to specific problems, but also 
          kept more generalized.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gridsix">
        <h3>Conditionals</h3>
        <p>In case we need our code to execute different things in case of different circumstances, 
          we can use conditional statements - to simply tell our code which route to take. For example: 
          if it rains, take an umbrella. Otherwise take your sunglasses!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gridseven">
        <h3>Loops</h3>
        <p>Do you remember when in elementary school you were punished by writing down a sentence 
          100 times? "I will not eat chocolate in class". Boring! Sometimes you have to run in circles a lot 
          before you can proceed. Luckily in Javascript you can use loops, which will cycle trhough the circles 
          for you fast, so you don't have to write hundreds of lines of code!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="grideight">
        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>Arrays are another datatype in Javascript. We talk about strings, numbers, and booleans 
          as primitive datatypes. Arrays and objects can be referenced as composide datatypes. 
          Arrays basically can store multiple values in one string. For example, if you want to store 
          elements in a café's menu, you could use an array that has espresso, cappuccino, latte, and so on.
        </p>
      </div>


      <div class="gridnine">
        <h3>Objects</h3>
        <p>Objects can store as well multiple values, just like arrays. But objects can also store the 
          names of these values. For example: basic coffee: espresso. Fancy coffee: cappuccino. Special coffee: Oatmilk latte. 
          Objects can also have functions associated with them, these functions are called methods.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="gridten">
        <h3>Random numbers</h3>
        <p>Being able to generate random numbers is essential for working with Javascript. 
          For a lot of different problems we need random numbers to be able to give a solution. 
          For example if we want to write a program that gives PIN codes to users, random numbers are 
          the way to go. But there is a difference between truly random, and pseudorandom numbers.
